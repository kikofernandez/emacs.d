# Pony emacs.d
===============
This is my emacs configuration. I'll be tweaking it to make it work with the languages I use the most.


## Requirements
-------------
* Emacs 24
* To make the most of the programming language-specific support in
  this config, further programs will likely be required, particularly
  those that [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) uses to
  provide on-the-fly syntax checking.
* Assumes you have installed Cask under ~/.cask

## Similar configs
-------------------
You might also want to check out `emacs-starter-kit` and `emacs-prelude`.
